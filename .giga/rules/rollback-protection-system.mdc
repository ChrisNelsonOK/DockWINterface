# rollback-protection-system

The rollback protection system implements a checkpoint-based recovery mechanism for Windows container deployments with the following key components:

## Core Protection Logic
- Located in rollback_manager.py
- Creates system checkpoints before critical infrastructure changes
- Implements differentiated timeout policies:
  * Network changes: 5 minutes
  * Container deployments: 3 minutes 
  * System-wide changes: 10 minutes
  * Macvlan changes: 7 minutes

## State Preservation
- Captures multi-domain system state:
  * Docker container configurations
  * Network interface settings
  * Routing tables
  * IPTables rules
  * Critical network states

## Health Monitoring
- Concurrent monitoring of:
  * Network connectivity using multiple fallback hosts
  * Docker container health states
  * System stability metrics
- Auto-triggers rollback on detected failures

## Checkpoint Management
- Manages checkpoint lifecycle:
  * Creation phase
  * Active monitoring phase
  * Confirmation/completion phase
- Integrates with RevertIT system
- Automatic cleanup of expired checkpoints

## Network-Specific Protection
- Custom handling for macvlan vs standard networking
- Additional safeguards for static IP configurations
- Network interface state preservation
- Routing table backups

Importance Score: 90/100
Justification: Core business logic protecting critical infrastructure with specialized Windows container handling and enterprise-grade recovery mechanisms
