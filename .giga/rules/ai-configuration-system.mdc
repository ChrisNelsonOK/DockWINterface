# ai-configuration-system

Core AI Configuration Logic:

1. Windows Environment Validation Engine
- Domain-specific rule validation for Windows container deployments
- Version compatibility matrix checking against supported Windows editions
- Resource allocation validation with Windows-specific minimums
- Network interface validation for Windows container networking modes

2. Configuration Optimization Service
- Automated analysis of Windows container configurations
- Resource allocation recommendations based on workload patterns
- Network topology optimization for Windows container scenarios
- Security baseline validation against Windows container best practices

3. AI Assistant Integration 
```python
# Core configuration analysis rules
WINDOWS_CONFIG_RULES = {
  'version_compatibility': {
    'windows_11': ['enterprise', 'pro', 'ltsc'],
    'windows_10': ['enterprise', 'ltsc'],
    'server': ['2022', '2025']
  },
  'resource_minimums': {
    'ram': '2GB',
    'cpu': '2',
    'disk': '20GB'
  }
}
```

4. Validation Pipeline
- Multi-stage configuration validation:
  * Windows version compatibility
  * Resource allocation checks
  * Network configuration validation
  * Security baseline assessment
- Configuration optimization recommendations
- Windows-specific deployment guidance

Key Files:
- ai_assistant.py: Core AI validation engine
- static/js/wizard.js: Configuration wizard integration
- docker_config.py: Configuration generation and validation

Importance Score: 85/100
The high score reflects the specialized nature of Windows container configuration validation and the unique domain-specific rules implemented for the Windows environment.
