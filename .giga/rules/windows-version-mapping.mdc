# windows-version-mapping

Core version mapping system implementing Windows container version compatibility and configuration rules:

## Version Translation Layer
```python
WINDOWS_VERSION_MAP = {
    '11-enterprise': '11',  # Enterprise redirected to Pro
    '11-ltsc': '11l',
    '10-enterprise': '10e', 
    '10-ltsc': '10l',
    '2025': '2025',
    '2022': '2022'
}
```

Location: `routes.py`, `docker_config.py`

## Version-Specific Configuration Rules

1. Resource Requirements
- Windows 11: Minimum 4GB RAM, 2 CPU cores
- Windows 10: Minimum 2GB RAM, 1 CPU core
- Server 2022/2025: Minimum 2GB RAM, 2 CPU cores

2. Feature Compatibility Matrix
- Enterprise versions require specialized licensing handling
- LTSC versions have extended support configurations
- Pro versions used as fallback for Enterprise deployments

## Version Validation Logic

1. Pre-deployment Checks
- OS version compatibility validation
- Resource requirement verification
- License type validation

2. Cross-Version Feature Management  
- Network stack compatibility checks
- Service availability mapping
- Rolling upgrade path validation

Importance Score: 85/100
- Critical for container deployment compatibility
- Handles complex Windows version requirements
- Manages enterprise licensing constraints
- Controls feature availability across versions
