## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The project implements specialized Windows container management with enterprise features through three core business domains:

## 1. Windows Container Configuration System
Location: `static/js/wizard.js`, `docker_config.py`

- Multi-step wizard implementing Windows-specific container configuration
- Version mapping system translating user-friendly versions to backend flags
- Enterprise network topology generation with multi-NIC support
- Resource allocation logic with Windows-specific constraints
- Rollback protection system with checkpoint-based recovery

## 2. AI-Powered Configuration Assistant 
Location: `ai_assistant.py`, `static/js/chat.js`

- Domain-specific AI system for Windows container expertise
- Contextual configuration analysis engine
- Specialized troubleshooting workflows
- Configuration optimization recommendations
- Windows environment compatibility validation

## 3. Enterprise Integration Layer
Location: `routes.py`, `rollback_manager.py`

- SNMP/WMI service integration for enterprise monitoring
- Multi-layer state preservation system
- Automated health monitoring with failure detection
- Network interface management with static IP support
- Deployment strategy logic for SSH and TCP-based paths

The business logic emphasizes specialized handling of Windows containers with enterprise requirements, implementing unique solutions for version compatibility, network management, and system monitoring. The integration between these components enables complex enterprise deployments while maintaining system stability through automated rollback protection.

Importance Score: 85/100
- Complex domain-specific implementation for Windows containers
- Unique rollback protection mechanisms
- Specialized enterprise service integration
- AI-powered configuration assistance
- Production-grade deployment safety features
