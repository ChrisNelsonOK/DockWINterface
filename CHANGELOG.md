## v0.9.1 (2025-08-29)

### Network Subnet Update
- **Changed internal VM network**: Updated from 192.168.100.0/24 to 192.254.254.0/24 to avoid conflicts
- **VM IP**: Windows VMs now use 192.254.254.21 internally (was 192.168.100.21)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
- Container must be rebuilt and redeployed to use new features
- `/opt/windows` directory must be mounted into container
- Windows volume directories require specific ownership (uid=1000)

### üîÑ Migration Required
- Stop and remove existing container
- Rebuild Docker image with new code
- Fix volume directory permissions: `chown -R 1000:1000 /opt/windows/xfer*`
- Deploy container with updated volume mounts

All notable changes to DockWINterface will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.2] - 2025-08-16

### Fixed
- **Critical Bug Fix**: Windows version normalization was not working in production
  - Root cause: `docker_config.py` line 281 incorrectly set VERSION under ram_size condition
  - Fixed by properly separating VERSION and RAM_SIZE environment variable assignments
  - Windows versions now correctly normalize (e.g., `11-enterprise` ‚Üí `11e`)
  - See `docs/WINDOWS_VERSION_FIX.md` for full details

- **Critical Boot Issue**: Windows containers unable to boot - "No bootable option or device was found"
  - Root cause: Missing `/dev/net/tun` device in container deployments
  - Fixed by adding `/dev/net/tun` to devices list in `docker_config.py` line 26
  - Updated SSH deployment logic to properly check for device existence before adding
  - Windows containers now boot and install correctly with full KVM + networking support

- **SSH Deployment Issue**: Enterprise features causing boot failures through SSH deployment
  - Root cause: Missing `--stop-timeout` parameter in SSH deployment docker command generation
  - Investigation confirmed all enterprise features (SNMP, logging, macvlan, rollback) work individually
  - Fixed by adding `stop_grace_period` to `--stop-timeout` conversion in `ssh_docker.py`
  - Enterprise features now fully functional: macvlan networking, rollback protection, SNMP monitoring, and logging integration

### Improved
- **Code Organization**: 
  - Moved all test files to `tests/` directory
  - Cleaned up root directory by removing temporary and debug files
  - Updated test imports to work from new location
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive fix documentation in `docs/WINDOWS_VERSION_FIX.md`
