# Changelog

All notable changes to DockWINterface will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.2] - 2025-08-16

### Fixed
- **Critical Bug Fix**: Windows version normalization was not working in production
  - Root cause: `docker_config.py` line 281 incorrectly set VERSION under ram_size condition
  - Fixed by properly separating VERSION and RAM_SIZE environment variable assignments
  - Windows versions now correctly normalize (e.g., `11-enterprise` â†’ `11e`)
  - See `docs/WINDOWS_VERSION_FIX.md` for full details

- **Critical Boot Issue**: Windows containers unable to boot - "No bootable option or device was found"
  - Root cause: Missing `/dev/net/tun` device in container deployments
  - Fixed by adding `/dev/net/tun` to devices list in `docker_config.py` line 26
  - Updated SSH deployment logic to properly check for device existence before adding
  - Windows containers now boot and install correctly with full KVM + networking support

- **SSH Deployment Issue**: Enterprise features causing boot failures through SSH deployment
  - Root cause: Missing `--stop-timeout` parameter in SSH deployment docker command generation
  - Investigation confirmed all enterprise features (SNMP, logging, macvlan, rollback) work individually
  - Fixed by adding `stop_grace_period` to `--stop-timeout` conversion in `ssh_docker.py`
  - Enterprise features now fully functional: macvlan networking, rollback protection, SNMP monitoring, and logging integration

### Improved
- **Code Organization**: 
  - Moved all test files to `tests/` directory
  - Cleaned up root directory by removing temporary and debug files
  - Updated test imports to work from new location
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive fix documentation in `docs/WINDOWS_VERSION_FIX.md`
